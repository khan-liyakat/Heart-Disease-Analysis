# Heart-Disease-Analysis

I've completed the ETL process for the heart disease diagnostic database and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. Here's what I've done:

Extracted the data from the heart disease diagnostic database.
Transformed the data by analyzing heart disease rates, heart disease by gender, and heart disease by age.
Loaded the transformed data for further analysis and visualization.
For heart disease rates, I calculated the overall rate of heart disease in the dataset and analyzed it by gender and age groups. Additionally, I visualized the data using various plots such as bar plots and histograms to gain insights into heart disease prevalence
